# 8 Bit Day Fedora Transform Background

It is intended for my Fedora GNOME desktop background. However, it might be used as background on GNOME desktop environment of other distributions.

## How to install

 - you need to have root access or at least `sudo`
 - put 8bit directory under /usr/share/backgrounds

     >``` # cp -r 8bit /usr/share/backgrounds/.```

 - put 8bit.xml under /usr/share/gnome-backgrounds/

     >``` # cp 8bit.xml /usr/share/gnome-backgrounds/.```
